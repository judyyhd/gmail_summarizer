TL;DR: a test project for myself to get familiarized with function-based mvp

Long version:
As I started my summer internship (summer 2025), I was asked to familiarize myself with function-based MVPs. These are small fuctions (or dictionaries, if you will), that will allow chatbots to interact with an API. For example, an MVP on the U.S. census DP API will allow the users to prompt a chatbot with "give me the average number of public school teacher in the U.S. in 2024", and the chatbot will interact with the census API and return the results in a conversational way. 

This seems especially cool because it directly leverages the chatbot, and there is no need for a fuction to decode the user's prompts into machine-actionable inputs. 

Maybe all these are obvious, but for someone that learned about it for the first time two hours ago, it all seems so cool and smart.

To familiarize myself with the actual inner-workings of this method, I am writing an MVP that will allow the chatbox to read my latest emails and summarizes the contents.
